# NodeVueStarterCore

This is a simple starter project connecting basic node.js backend with vue.js frontend and a simple api call. This can be built up into something actually useful, this is just to get you started quickly with these two technologies already hooked up.

To get started:

- navigate to '/server/src' and hit 'npm start' to start the backend
- navigate to /client/src' and hit 'npm start' to start the front end
- navigate to http://localhost:8080/#/register and input email and password and click the button
  - you will see a successful response from the back end in browser console
