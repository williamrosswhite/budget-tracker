# Budget Tracker

This is a project to make my budget tracking easier. Yes I know myriad software exists for this, but I want to make my own for the practice/experience and so I can set it up exactly as I want. This is also an excuse to learn vue.js and bone up on my node.js after just using asp.net at work for so long.

To get started:

- navigate to '/server/src' and hit 'npm start' to start the backend
- navigate to /client/src' and hit 'npm start' to start the front end
- navigate to http://localhost:8080/#/register and input email and password and click the button
  - you will see a successful response from the back end in browser console
